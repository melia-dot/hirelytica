        <div className="prose max-w-none space-y-6 text-gray-900">
          <p className="text-xl">The brutal reality facing tech, marketing, and sales professionals in June 2025. The numbers do not lie: the UK job market has become a battlefield where even the most qualified candidates are struggling to find work.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Harsh Reality: By the Numbers</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">The latest ONS figures paint a stark picture:</p>
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Unemployment has risen to 4.6% as of April 2025</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Job vacancies declining for 31st consecutive quarter</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Total vacancies dropped to 736,000 (150,000 drop vs last year)</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Youth unemployment surged to 14.3% (625,000 young people unemployed)</p>
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Youth Unemployment: A Generation Under Siege</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">For young people aged 16-24, the situation is particularly brutal. Nearly 1 in 5 young people are unemployed, with close to 1 million young people out of work. Traditional entry routes in tech, marketing, and sales have virtually disappeared.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Tech Sector: Not the Safe Haven It Once Was</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">Despite narratives about tech booming, job postings in tech categories are among those furthest below pre-pandemic baselines. The UK trails behind Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the US in tech job postings.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">The AI Paradox</h3>
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <p className="text-gray-900">• 68% of tech professionals actively looking for new roles</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• AI-related jobs expanding 3.6x faster than average positions</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Skills in AI roles evolving 25% faster than other professions</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• 98% of tech employees want AI literacy, only 27% currently use AI</p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">The Experience Trap</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-900">71% of organizations report cybersecurity skills shortages, yet they are unwilling to train candidates without direct experience. Entry-level positions have vanished, replaced by senior roles requiring years of experience that few possess.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Marketing and Sales: The Forgotten Sectors</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">2024 was particularly tough for marketing jobs, with December rounding off 14 months of reported decline in overall vacancies. For senior marketers, roles felt few and far between, while graduate and entry-level positions saw a lack of hiring intention.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">The Salary Expectations Gap</h3>
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <p className="text-gray-900">• 93% of employers find it challenging to find right mix of skills</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• 58% struggle to meet candidate salary expectations</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Job processes have become longer and more complicated</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Salary offers consistently below expectations</p>
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Recruitment Death Spiral</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Employer Selectivity at All-Time Highs</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-900">Recruitment firms report employers showing increased caution towards committing to long-term hires, citing economic uncertainty, budgetary constraints, and rising payroll costs. Permanent placements have declined for 31 consecutive months.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">The Application Black Hole</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-900">74% of hiring managers can identify when AI has been used in applications, often perceiving them as repetitive and lacking authenticity. Yet with hundreds of applications per role, candidates feel forced to use AI tools just to keep up.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Extended Hiring Processes</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-900">With 65% of employers struggling to find candidates with the right skill set and 59% feeling pressured to fill roles quickly while being more selective, hiring processes have become painfully extended, often lasting months.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Regional Variations: The London Problem</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">London has the highest youth unemployment rate at 20.2%, compared to the UK average of 13.4%. The concentration of opportunity in the capital has created a bottleneck effect, with thousands competing for limited positions while facing astronomical living costs.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Skills Mismatch Crisis</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">The data reveals a fundamental disconnect: while 65% of employers cite finding candidates with the right skills as their primary challenge, job advertisements often list unrealistic requirements combining multiple specialized skill sets that would normally require entire teams.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">The Experience Paradox</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-900">Entry-level positions now routinely require 2-3 years of experience, while companies simultaneously complain about talent shortages. Organizations are being forced to deprioritize experience to find talent faster, but this shift is happening too slowly to help current job seekers.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Why Traditional Job Hunting Fails in 2025</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">The old playbook is broken. With job postings on Reed.co.uk down to 112,990 in March 2025, significantly below the 160,378 jobs posted in March 2024, competition for each remaining position has intensified dramatically.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">The Hidden Job Market</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-900">Many positions are never advertised publicly, filled through internal networks or recruitment agencies before reaching job boards. With only 14.6% of jobs offering remote or hybrid options, location has become another barrier for many candidates.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Economic Headwinds</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">The BDO Business Trends report reveals UK employment has reached a new 12-year low as businesses grapple with rising labour costs and global uncertainty, with vacancies falling below pre-pandemic levels for the first time in four years.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What This Means for Job Seekers</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">The job market of June 2025 is fundamentally different from previous years. Success requires:</p>
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Hyper-specialization in emerging technologies</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Network-first job searching strategies</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Flexible expectations around roles and compensation</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Continuous upskilling to stay relevant</p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">• Geographic flexibility to access opportunities</p>
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900">If you are struggling to find work in tech, marketing, or sales, you are not failing the system is. With unemployment-to-vacancy ratios climbing to 2.2 unemployed people per vacancy, up from 1.7 a year ago, the mathematical reality is that there simply are not enough jobs for the number of qualified candidates.</p>

          <p className="text-gray-900">The job market of 2025 is not just competitive it is brutal. Understanding these realities is the first step toward developing strategies that actually work in this new landscape. The old rules no longer apply, and recognizing that fact might be the most important career decision you make this year.</p>
